# OQS-python

This docker image contains python3 with library support for quantum-safe crypto (QSC) operations.

To this end, it contains [liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs) as well
as [OQS-OpenSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl) from the [OpenQuantumSafe](https://openquantumsafe.org)
project all wrapped up in Python APIs using [liboqs-python](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python).

## Quick start

- Executing `docker run -it openquantumsafe/python` tests all QSC algorithms against the interop server
  at https://test.openquantumsafe.org.
- Executing `docker run -it openquantumsafe/python sh` provides a shell environment where liboqs and QSC-enabled SSL/TLS
  is available for use. See the included file `minitest.py` for sample code exercizing this functionality.

## Further examples

More samples are available
at [liboqs-python examples](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python/tree/main/examples).
